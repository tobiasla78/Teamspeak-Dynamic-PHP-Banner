# Teamspeak-Dynamic-PHP-Banner
With this script you can easily build a dynamic Teamspeak banner. This script is for Teamspeak admins only. You can add a custom message on the banner or print the current time on the banner.
You can print everything you want on the image.

# How it works
As an Teamspeak-Server administrator you can change the banner to an php file. Thats brings a lot of possibilities for example we can print the current time on the banner every 60 seconds. You can also access the php-image from your browser. Here is a <a href="https://www.renort.net/github/image.php">demo</a>.

# Set-up

Change the "Banner Gfx Url" in the Teamspeak client to <code>http://your_host/image.php</code> and the "Gfx Interval" to 60 seconds for the fastest update interval.
